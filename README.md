# Project Structure Overview
This project follows a modular structure to effectively manage different modules within a single application. Here's a brief overview:

### Modules Folder (modules)
    * Contains separate folders for each module of the application.
    * Each module folder encapsulates all related components, styles, and typings.
    * Following this approach ensures better organization and maintainability.

### Common Components Folder (common)
    * Houses reusable components that can be shared across multiple modules.
    * Encourages code reusability and minimizes duplication.

### Global Styling File (App.scss)
    * Manages global-level styles, including utility classes and common styling rules.
    * Centralizing styling in one file promotes consistency throughout the application.

**Note**: This project has only one module.
